# Let's pythonize other languages!

My modest attempt to port the python stdlib API to other languages, along with its sugary syntax.

General guidelines/remarks/etc.:

 - only 1 single-file include for each language
 - only use the target language stdlib, no external dependencies
 - minimal effort usage design: the less typing needed the better
 - avoid internal code dependencies so partial reusability is possible by copy-pasting portions of the code
   Also useful as a quick-reference for python alternatives in other langs.
 - made for fun/educative purposes, use at your own risk
